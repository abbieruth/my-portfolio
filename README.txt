<h1>My Portfolio</h1>
<p>If you want to know more about me or my work or even want to hire me, then check out my webiste <a href="https://abigail-noel.netlify.app/">here</a>!</p>



<h2>How It's Made</h2>
<p><a href="https://html5up.net/miniport">Miniport Template by HTML5 UP</a> (Free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license))
 (aj@lkn.io | @ajlkn), 
HTML, CSS (JavaScript and Sass came with the template; I did not code those.)</p>



<p>This is just a quick portfolio, something to tell you a little bit about me and showcase my work.</p>


PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).
